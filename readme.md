## 🚀 Features (Public Edition)

* CPU: LR35902 interpreter (Work-in-Progress)
* WebGL renderer (BG tiles, Window, Sprites)
* VRAM & OAM emulation

## 🧠 About RJS (Revolution JavaScript)

RJS is a compact, expressive, and highly productive JavaScript dialect featuring:

* Python-like readability
* Clean DSL-like syntax
* Special operators (`:=`, `::`, `:>`, `:e`, `:~`)
* Zero-runtime overhead
* A custom compiler (closed-source)

This emulator serves as a **showcase project** demonstrating how RJS scales to real systems.
